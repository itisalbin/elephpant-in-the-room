# Code Review

Code review written by [Oliver Davis](https://github.com/DavisDavisDavis).

1. `style-index.css` - Try dividing up the CSS into different files for each section E.g one file for media queries or another for css variables.
2. `style-index.css:275` - Super small detail but when scaling down into mobile view the numbers stop being in the center.
3. `style-index.css` - When comparing two animals with two long names the text can overlap

5. `style.css:210-211` - Just an empty css class üê±  
6. `index.php:28` - For readability it could be useful to change the variable from $i to $j because the variable is also shared with the for loop above (line 17).

This was a super fun website and probably the most unique one in our class! üëç Can't wait to see what you will do next.
